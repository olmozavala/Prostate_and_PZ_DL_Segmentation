	abstract = {A variant of the popular nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3) algorithm is proposed for bias ﬁeld correction. Given the superb performance of N3 and its public availability, it has been the subject of several evaluation studies. These studies have demonstrated the importance of certain parameters associated with the B-spline least-squares ﬁtting. We propose the substitution of a recently developed fast and robust B-spline approximation routine and a modiﬁed hierarchical optimization scheme for improved bias ﬁeld correction over the original N3 algorithm. Similar to the N3 algorithm, we also make the source code, testing, and technical documentation of our contribution, which we denote as “N4ITK,” available to the public through the Insight Toolkit of the National Institutes of Health. Performance assessment is demonstrated using simulated data He from the publicly available Brainweb database, hyperpolarized 3 lung image data, and 9.4T postmortem hippocampus data.},

	title = {Automatic High Resolution Segmentation of the Prostate from Multi-Planar {MRI}},
	abstract = {Individualized and accurate segmentations of the prostate are essential for diagnosis as well as therapy planning in prostate cancer ({PCa}). Most of the previously proposed prostate segmentation approaches rely purely on axial {MRI} scans, which suffer from low out-of-plane resolution. We propose a method that makes use of sagittal and coronal {MRI} scans to improve the accuracy of segmentation. These scans are typically acquired as standard of care for {PCa} staging, but are generally ignored by the segmentation algorithms. Our method is based on a multi-stream 3D convolutional neural network for the automatic extraction of isotropic high resolution segmentations from {MR} images. We evaluated segmentation performance on an isotropic high resolution ground truth (n = 40 subjects). The results show that the use of multi-planar volumes for prostate segmentation leads to improved segmentation results not only for the whole prostate (92.1\% Dice similarity coefﬁcient), but also in apex and base regions.},

	abstract = {We present the detailed planning and execution of the Insight Toolkit ({ITK}), an application programmers interface ({API}) for the segmentation and registration of medical image data. This public resource has been developed through the {NLM} Visible Human Project, and is in beta test as an open-source software offering under cost-free licensing. The toolkit concentrates on 3D medical data segmentation and registration algorithms, multimodal and multiresolution capabilities, and portable platform independent support for Windows, Linux/Unix systems. This toolkit was built using current practices in software engineering. Specifically, we embraced the concept of generic programming during the development of these tools, working extensively with C++ templates and the freedom and flexibility they allow. Additional software development tools for distributed consortium-based code development have been created and are available from the project. In this paper, we discuss our assumptions, design decisions, and some of the lessons we have learned.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel two-frame motion estimation algorithm. The ﬁrst step is to approximate each neighborhood of both frames by quadratic polynomials, which can be done eﬃciently using the polynomial expansion transform. From observing how an exact polynomial transforms under translation a method to estimate displacement ﬁelds from the polynomial expansion coeﬃcients is derived and after a series of reﬁnements leads to a robust algorithm. Evaluation on the Yosemite sequence shows good results.},
