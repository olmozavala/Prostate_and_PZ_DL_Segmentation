\begin{abstract}
A modified version of the well established 3D U-net architecture is proposed
for automatic segmentation of the prostate and its peripheral zone (PZ) using
multiplanar MRI. The proposed architecture is a multistream convolutional
neuronal network that uses axial, coronal, and sagittal MRI series as input. 
428 scans from multiple vendors are used to test the robustness 
of the proposed architecture against distinct MRI magnets . Additionally, the 
effect of 3D data augmentation  is evaluated.
The proposed segmentation scheme achieved good results for prostate and PZ compared to expert
contoured volumes. Combining images from different MRI vendors on the training of 
the network is of paramount importance for training a universal model for
prostate and pheripheral zone segmentation.
