\small{
\textbf{Purpose:} Develop an automatic segmentation algorithm for the prostate and its peripheral zone (PZ) that
is robust across multiple MRI vendors. \\
\textbf{Methods:} A modified version of the 3D U-net neural network is used for automatic segmentation of the prostate and its PZ using multiplanar MRI. The network is a multi-stream convolutional neural network that uses axial, coronal, and sagittal MRI series as input. The preprocessing of the input data includes image normalization, bias correction, and resampling of the images and ground truth contours. A large dataset of 550 scans from multiple MRI vendors (Siemens and GE), is used to test the proposed network. Six different models were trained, three for the prostate and three for the PZ, splitting and combining the training datasets with each MRI vendor. The S\o rosen-Dice coefficient (DSC) is used to compare the performance of the system. \\
\textbf{Results:} The best model achieves DSCs of $0.896 \pm 0.037$ and  $0.830 \pm 0.054$ for segmenting the prostate in each dataset respectively (Siemens and GE). For PZ segmentation, the DSCs of the top model are $0.813 \pm 0.079$ and $0.797 \pm 0.093$. The leading results are consistently obtained when the network is trained with the combined dataset, with just one exception. \\
\textbf{Conclusion:} The proposed system has a performance comparable to the inter-observer variability for segmenting the prostate and its PZ from MRI. Combining images from different MRI vendors on the training of the network is of paramount importance for building a universal model for prostate and PZ segmentation.
