A modified version of the 3D U-net architecture is used for automatic segmentation of the prostate and its peripheral zone (PZ) using multiplanar MRI. The neural network (NN) architecture is a multistream convolutional NN (CNN) that uses axial, coronal, and sagittal MRI series as input.  A large dataset of 557 scans from multiple MRI vendors is used to analyze the consequences of training the CNN with distinct MRI magnets.  The proposed segmentation scheme achieved good results for prostate and PZ compared to expert contoured volumes. Combining images from different MRI vendors on the training of the network is of paramount importance for training an universal model for prostate and peripheral zone segmentation.
