\begin{abstract}
A modified version of a well stablished 3D U-net architecture is proposed
for the automatic segmentation of the prostate and its pheripheral zone. The
proposed architecture is tested with 430 MRI series from multiple vendors. 
The robustnes of the proposed architecture is analyzed by cross training
it with MRI series from selected types of MRI magnets. Additionally, the 
effects of performing 3D data augmentation on medical imaging is addressed
by analyzing the peformance of the trained network with and without 
The abstract should appear at the top of the left-hand column of text, about
