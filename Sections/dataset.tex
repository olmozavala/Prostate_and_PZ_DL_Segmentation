The prostate and the peripheral zone (PZ) were manually contoured on T2-weighted Axial MRI (T2W) in MIM (MIM Software Inc, Cleveland, OH, USA) by imaging experts (RS, ALB) with more than 25 years combined expertise in prostate cancer. The contours were cross checked by the two imaging experts and reviewed by radiation oncologists (MCA, AP) with extensive expertise in genitourinary malignancies. Two datasets were considered: (i) imaging data from the SPIE-AAPM-NCI PROSTATEx Challenge \cite{deukwoo_classification_2018} (330 cases), acquired on two different types of Siemens 3T MR scanners, the MAGNETOM Trio and Skyra (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), and  (ii) MRI data from patients in radiotherapy clinical trials at the University of Miami (220 cases), acquired on Discovery MR750 3T MRI (GE, Waukesha, WI, USA).  Compared to most publications, this dataset is one of the largest and more heterogeneous ones \cite{anneke,litjens2014evaluation,chowdhury2012concurrent,toth2012multifeature,4_klein2008automatic,5_cheng2014atlas,6_xie2014low,7_tian2015fully,8_korsager2015use,jia20183d}.
