\label{subsec:dataset}
The prostate and the peripheral zone (PZ) were manually
contoured on T2-weighted Axial MRI (T2W) in MIM (MIM Software Inc,
Cleveland, OH, USA) by imaging experts (RS, ALB) with more than
25 years combined expertise in prostate cancer. The contours were cross
checked by the two imaging experts and reviewed by radiation
oncologists (MCA, AP) with extensive expertise in genitourinary
malignancies. Two datasets were considered: (i) imaging data from the
SPIE-AAPM-NCI PROSTATEx Challenge \cite{deukwoo_classification_2018} (328 cases), 
acquired on two different types of Siemens 3T MR scanners, the MAGNETOM Trio
and Skyra (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), and  (ii) MRI data from
patients in radiotherapy clinical trials at the University of Miami (100 cases),
acquired on Discovery MR750 3T MRI (GE, Waukesha, WI, USA).
