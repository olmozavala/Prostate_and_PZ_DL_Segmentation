\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Accurate prostate segmentation on MRI datasets is required for many clinical and research applications. In addition, due to the different imaging properties of the peripheral (PZ) and transition zones (TZ) of the prostate, accurate zonal segmentation is also necessary.  The prostate and zonal contours are necessary for computer aided diagnosis (CAD) applications for staging, diagnosis, and treatment planning for prostate cancer. In a series of applications, prostate contours are fused with ultrasound images to guide prostate biopsies. Automatic segmentation of the prostate, PZ and TZ on MR images provides an opportunity to broaden the current scope of research by facilitating studies that include large populations of subjects and/or studies that incorporate serial imaging of the prostate to grant a longitudinal picture of disease progression and response.  Prostate MRI image segmentation has been an area of intense research \cite{litjens2014evaluation}. Earlier, the applied approaches varied from model-based \cite{chowdhury2012concurrent,toth2012multifeature}, to atlas-based segmentation \cite{4_klein2008automatic,5_cheng2014atlas,6_xie2014low,7_tian2015fully,8_korsager2015use,9_chilali2016gland}.  Our group also evaluated the performance of atlas-based approach for prostate and prostate zones segmentation using data from different MRI vendors and acquisition parameters \cite{10_padgett2018towards}. The advent of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) has led to great success in image classification \cite{11_krizhevsky2012imagenet,12_simonyan2011immediate}.  Also, the winners of the PROMISE12 MICCAI Grand Challenge \cite{litjens2014evaluation} for the automatic segmentation of the prostate,  used a volumetric Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and achieved a Dice Coefficient (DSC) of 89.43\% \cite{yu2017volumetric}.  Recently, the U-Net architecture has been proposed \cite{13_ronneberger2015u} for medical imaging segmentation and multiple variations have been applied to the prostate with state of the art results \cite{anneke}. In this work we augment upon the architecture of the 3D CNN and analyze its performance for the automatic segmentation not only of the  prostate, but also its PZ. As with our atlas-based approach \cite{10_padgett2018towards}, the goal of the described developments was to segue towards universal approach that is able to segment the prostate and prostate zones, regardless of acquisition protocols, magnetic field strength or type of scanners. A core contribution is made by the pre-processing of the images in order to harmonize the data and optimizing the network performance when training and testing is carried out in dataset of 550 scans  from two different MRI-vendors.
