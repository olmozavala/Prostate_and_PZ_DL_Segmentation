\section{Discussion/Conclusions}
\label{sec:disc}
Manual contouring of the prostate requires slice-by-slice contouring 
in axial or in any of the other two views. Besides labor intensive, manual 
contouring is prone to inter-observer variability and imperfections 
in the 3D delineation. The 3D CNN results in this paper show 
that in addition to efficiency and reproducibility, automatic prostate and PZ 
segmentation can be achieved with accuracy, similar to the expert's manual 
contours reproducibility results. Our robustness tests show a strong 
sensibility of this deep learning architecture with respect to the MRI vendor
used for training.
