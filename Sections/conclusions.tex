\section{Discussion/Conclusions}
\ref{sec:disc}
Manual contouring of the prostate requires slice-by-slice contouring 
in axial or in any of the other two views. Besides labor intensive, manual 
contouring is prone to inter-observer variability and imperfections 
in the 3D delamination (Figure 1). The U-net results in this paper show 
that in addition to efficiency and reproducibility, automatic prostate segmentation can be 
achieved with accuracy, similar to the expertâ€™s manual contours reproducibility results.
